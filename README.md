🛑 Admin-Only Spawn Issue

There is a known issue where:

The Nextbot may show as admin-only

OR sometimes both admins and non-admins can spawn it

This is a Garry’s Mod / Nextbot limitation and not intentional.

👉 Please ignore the spawn menu and do not spawn it unless told to.

🧭 Troubleshooting

Nextbot does not move?

The map probably has no navmesh

Run this in console:


nav_generate



⚠️ This may lag or freeze the game on large maps.
